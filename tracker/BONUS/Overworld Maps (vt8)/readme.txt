Since Chest and Heart Piece locations are indistinct in randomizer, all items are represented by a chest, regardless of whether it's an actual chest or standing item.

COLOR KEY:
    Black - Required Items, NPCs, or events
    Blue - Requirement to enter a dungeon, or get past the first room
    Gray - Possible requirement, based on chest distribution within a dungeon
    Yellow - Not a required item, but extremely useful
    Green Portal - Dark World side of an overworld portal
    Green Mirror - Should correspond to a Black Mirror on the Light World Map
    Other Green -  Item required to cross terrain

- When required items are aligned vertically, it means you need one or the other; not both.
- Medallions required to enter levels 6 and 7 are random.
- Power Glove and L2 Sword need the corresponding item of equal or greater value.
- "Dwarf" requirement means you need to reunite the blacksmiths to get a certain item. (Purple Chest and Power Bombs)
- Items required to enter a dungeon don't include items required to reach the entrance: only to open the door or get past the first room.

- Sorry for the chest layout in Swamp Palace, but it makes sense if you think about it!
- Moon Pearl is required for MOST items in DW or items that require Mirror.
    Notable exceptions: 2 chests at the bottom of Death Mountain East, and Mirror from NE of Mire don't require Moon Pearl.
- If multiple dungeon chests have a gray requirement, it may be possible to get some (but not all) of those chests without the item.
- The 3 chests on the west side of LW graveyard represent the 3 chests in the latter part of escape.
    Power Glove is required if you don't get the chests (don't have bomb/boots) at the beginning of the game.



Any questions? Did I make a mistake, or is there a better way to explain something? Hit me up!

*sort of. Edits from v6 to vt8...
	- Changed Master Sword, Tempered Sword, Butter Sword, and Silver Arrows to chests
	- replaced pendants and crystals with bosses
	- added a chest for each boss, but this means that "possibly required" items
		may now ACTUALLY BE REQUIRED!
